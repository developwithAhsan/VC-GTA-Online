## What Is This?

This is a complete **browser-based port of GTA: Vice City** built on the [reVCDOS](https://github.com/Lolendor/reVCDOS) reverse-engineered engine and compiled to WebAssembly. The full game — all missions, open world, vehicles, radio stations, and cutscenes — runs directly in a browser tab.

Game files (~701 MB) are downloaded once and stored permanently in your browser's local storage (OPFS). After the first visit the game loads instantly offline with no CDN dependency and no recurring downloads.

## How It Works

```
Browser visit
    │
    ▼
Service Worker registers
    │
    ▼
OPFS checked for cached game files
    │
    ├─ Found ──► PLAY button enabled immediately (instant load)
    │
    └─ Not found ──► Auto-download game archive (~701 MB)
                          │
                          ▼
                    Web Worker extracts tar.gz → writes files to OPFS
                          │
                          ▼
                    Service Worker serves /vcbr/ and /vcsky/ from OPFS
                          │
                          ▼
                    WASM engine (reVC) boots → game renders to <canvas>
```

### Architecture

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Frontend | Vanilla JS + Vite |
| Game engine | WebAssembly (reVCDOS / reVC) |
| Local storage | OPFS (Origin Private File System) |
| Asset serving | Service Worker — intercepts `/vcbr/` and `/vcsky/` |
| Download proxy | Vite plugin — proxies archive.org CDN, handles CORS & redirects |
| Touch input | Custom GamepadEmulator — maps screen drag zones to virtual gamepad axes |
| Save persistence | IDBFS (IndexedDB-backed filesystem) |

---

## Mobile Touch Controls

On any touch device, a full on-screen control overlay appears automatically when the game starts:

| Zone | Action |
|------|--------|
| Left half of screen — drag | Move character / steer vehicle |
| Right half of screen — drag | Rotate camera |
| Top-left | Pause / Menu |
| Below pause | Cheat keyboard |
| Right side — on foot | Get in car · Punch |
| Right side — in car | Get out · Handbrake |
| Bottom-right — on foot | Sprint · Jump |
| Top-right — on foot | Cycle weapon |
| Top-right — in car | Camera · Horn |
| Centre-top — in car | Radio station switcher |

Controls switch automatically when you enter or exit a vehicle. All controls are hidden during cutscenes and menus so you can navigate them freely.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `W A S D` | Move / Drive |

## Running Locally

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- pnpm (`npm install -g pnpm`)

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/developwithAhsan/VC-GTA-Online.git
cd VC-GTA-Online
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:5000`. The dev server proxies the game archive download automatically — no manual file setup needed.

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `VITE_ASSET_URL` | archive.org CDN URL | Override the `game.tar.gz` download source |

## Browser Requirements

The game uses four modern browser APIs:

| API | Purpose | Minimum version |
|-----|---------|----------------|
| WebAssembly | Game engine execution | Chrome 57, Firefox 52, Safari 11 |
| Service Workers | Asset serving from OPFS | Chrome 45, Firefox 44, Safari 11.1 |
| OPFS | Local game file storage | Chrome 86, Firefox 111, Safari 15.2 |
| SharedArrayBuffer | WASM threading | Chrome 92, Firefox 79, Safari 15.2 |

> SharedArrayBuffer requires `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin` and `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp` headers. The dev server and production server set these automatically.

## FAQ

**Is this the full GTA Vice City game?**
Yes. All missions, vehicles, weapons, and radio stations from the original 2002 release are present.

**Do I need to upload any files?**
No. Game files download automatically on first visit (~701 MB). Every visit after that loads instantly from your browser's local storage.

**Does it work on iPhone and Android?**
Yes. Full touch controls appear automatically on mobile. Play in landscape orientation for the best experience.

**Why do physics act weird or missions fail?**
The original game was engineered for 30 FPS. Running at higher framerates causes physics glitches. Set the FPS Limit to 30 in the settings panel to fix mission-critical physics bugs.

**Can I use a gamepad / controller?**
Yes. Any USB or Bluetooth gamepad is recognized automatically on desktop via the browser's Gamepad API.

**How do I transfer my PC save file?**
Use the Save Manager on the page to upload a `.b` save file from your PC installation (`Documents/Rockstar Games/GTA Vice City/User Files/`). You can also download your browser save as a backup at any time.

**Does it work offline after the first download?**
Yes. Once the game files are cached in OPFS, the Service Worker serves everything locally. No internet connection needed after first setup.

## Technical Notes

- The WASM engine is built from [reVC](https://github.com/SugaryHull/re3/tree/miami) — an open-source reverse-engineered reimplementation of the GTA Vice City engine
- Game configuration (`revc.ini`) is written to IDBFS at startup; `Method=1` is set automatically on touch devices to enable analog gamepad input mapping
- Touch control zones use the Pointer Events API with `setPointerCapture` for reliable multi-touch tracking across all mobile browsers
- Game state transitions (on-foot ↔ in-car, menu open/closed, cutscene active) are driven by direct `dataset` attribute writes from WASM `ASM_CONSTS` callbacks — CSS attribute selectors instantly show or hide the correct control buttons with zero JavaScript
- `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy` and `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy` headers are required for SharedArrayBuffer; both are set on all response paths
